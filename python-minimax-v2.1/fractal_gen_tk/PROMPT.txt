implement an interactive fractal generator in python

* use python-tk for rendering
* include the following ui elements:
** drop-down to select from various fractal set types (mandelbrot, julia, etc)
** drop-down menu to select from various color palettes
** slider to increase/decrease the iteration limit
* allow the user to select a rectangular area on the canvas to initiate a zoom
* when zooming, first render existing data from the selection area expanded to fill the canvas, then overwrite that data with calculated pixels
* produce a modular design that easily supports additional fractal types
* easily support additional color palettes
* initially support sequential processing; easily support parallel in the future
